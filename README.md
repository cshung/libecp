## sign_secp224k1

This standalone executable utility may be called from scripts to sign CoinFLEX authentication messages.
It reads from its standard input 28 bytes comprising the private key, followed by 28 bytes comprising the message hash to sign.
It then computes an elliptic-curve signature over the **secp224k1** curve and writes to its standard output 28 bytes comprising the *r* component of the signature, followed by 28 bytes comprising the *s* component.
All of these 28-byte integers are encoded with the most significant byte first.
See the `contrib` subdirectory for example scripts that make use of this utility to sign CoinFLEX authentication messages.
See [AUTH.md](https://github.com/coinflex-exchange/API/blob/master/AUTH.md) for more details about authenticating to Coinfloor.

### Build
